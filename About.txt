Geofencing 2017 Hackathon

Problems:
	Many patrons particularly new patrons of oahus public transit systems are unfamilliar with routes.

	Patrons that sleep on routes Often miss their stops. 
	
	Bus cancelations often go unreported
	
	Gps support is Spoty and inconsistant.
	
	The Bus system is difficult to navegate without prior knowledge  
	"on the fly" (look at sydney and tokyo for an example of better implementations)

	Lack of bus stop postings
	
	General Unreliability.

	Random bus cancelation without prior notice.

	Buses often run late

	Bus stops tell you what routs stop there, but dont say where they go. 

	Bus stops dont show connections.
	
	Bus lateness.
	
	Busses leave early.
	
	"I have to show up 30 minutes early for a buss that get me there late"
	"its the worst large scale public transit system ive ever seen"
	"its my biggest pet peeve with hawaii".
